"@nordcom/nordstar-card": patch
---

Added a solid variant to the `<Card/>` component. This new variant has a defined background, no padding, and no border. The default variant remains unchanged.

Introduced the use of data-attributes for color and variant. This allows for more flexibility and customization of the `<Card/>` component. The data-attributes are `data-color` and `data-variant`.

Added styling for all variations of the `<Card/>` component. This includes the default and solid variants, as well as the default, primary, and secondary colors.

These changes enhance the versatility and usability of the `<Card/>` component in the `@nordcom/nordstar-card` package.
