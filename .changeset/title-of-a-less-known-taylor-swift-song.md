"@nordcom/nordstar-card": patch
---

Added a new solid variant to the `<Card/>` component. The solid variant has a defined background, no padding, and no border. The default background-color is `--color-foreground` and the color is `--color-background`. Also added new props for variant and color. Both variant and color are optional and not required.
