# [@nordcom/nordstar-system](https://nordstar.dev/docs/customization/system/?utm_source=nordstar&utm_campaign=oss)

General utility libraries and tools used by all of the Nordstar components, hooks and packages. Also currently provides the theming for all components, which should be extracted to another package.

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> This is an internal package and should probably not be installed by itself, but rather come as a dependency of `@nordcom/nordstar`.

```sh
npm install @nordcom/nordstar-system
```
