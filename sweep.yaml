rules:
    - "Commit titles should start with the effected area of the code followed by a description and then a period and should be no longer than 72 characters. For example `Button: Add an alternative solid variant."
    - "Do not use conventional commits."
    - "Always squash changes, never do fixup commits."
    - "Code should be covered by unit tests using vitest in a `{filename}.tests.{ts,tsx} file."
    - "Any clearly inefficient or repeated code should be optimized or refactored."
    - "Follow our style guidelines and the contribution guidelines detailed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`."
    - "Remove any comments before code that are obvious. For example `// this prints hello world; console.log('hello world');`."
    - "Leftover TODOs in the code should be handled."
    - "Add a changeset file in `./.changeset/` when adding, changing or removing a feature. Use lowercase and dashes naming of the file and, as an easteregg, always use a title of a Taylor Swift song. For example `./.changeset/back-to-december.md`."
