# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nordstar! We're thrilled that you are here, and we welcome all contributors regardless of skill or experience level as we believe that everyone can be great with the right support and guidance.

To keep the project running smoothly, we have a few guidelines that we ask contributors to follow. These guidelines are intended to help you understand what we expect in terms of code quality, issue reporting, pull request submissions, and most importantly, community interactions and conduct from our contributors and what you can expect from us in return.

## Questions, Feedback, or Support

Open an issue on GitHub if you have questions or feedback regarding the Nordstar project or these contribution guidelines. For general support, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WgYVtCbR6J) and ask in the `#nordstar` channel or contact us directly via email at [opensource@nordcom.io](mailto:opensource@nordcom.io).

## Language Policy

While we are a global community, we ask that all communications be kept in English. This is to ensure that all contributors can understand each other and to keep the community inclusive and welcoming to all. Additionally we also ask that all user-facing string, code, code comments, commit messages, and documentation follow the following language policy:

 - Use American English, e.g. `color` instead of `colour`.
 - Always use proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling, avoid slang and uncommon abbreviations.
 - Write in an authoritative tone, but not a bossy one. Be friendly and welcoming to all.

We recommend the use of spell-, grammar-checkers and other tooling to help you with this. Some browsers like `MSEdge` include powerful grammar and spell-checkers out of the box.

## Copyright

When making a major contribution (e.g. adding a new feature or changing an existing one), please add your (or your employers) name to the bottom of the copyright holders in the `LICENSE` file. This is to ensure that you are properly credited for your work and get to retain the rights to your contributions.
